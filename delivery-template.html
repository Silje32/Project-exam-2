      <th>Design Prototype</th>
      <td> I used Adobe XD when I designed my prototype. I took my inspiration from Facebook and made my "/" page 
      my login page. Then I wanted the random list of posts to be on my home page. I also created a comment button
      so you could see the comments on each post. On My Profile page you can find the banner, avatar, 
      searchbar to find other profiles and a list of his/her personal posts. I also made a
      link in my nav bar to go to a Create Post page so you can easily and fast access and write and publish 
      your posts.

      <th>Kanban Board</th>
      <td> First I had to refresh my brain what a Kanban Board actually was. I had totally forgot. I found some 
        information I could use in Project Methodology module 1. 

        One week before my project ended I decided to make a new Kanban board. Only this time with pages 
        and API calls instead of pages and user stories. I wrote all my 9 pages on pink sticker notes before I
        put it on the table. Then I wrote all my API calls on yellow sticker notes with the name of my function 
        below the url. 

        In the end I visited the page "https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/social/posts" and  
        "https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/social/profiles" to make sure that my API calls were correct.
        After putting all my yellow sticker notes under each page I descovered I had forgot a page. 
        I didnÂ´t create the FOLLOWING page. I also discovered I had missed one delete button and that I 
        needed an api call for my searchbar.
