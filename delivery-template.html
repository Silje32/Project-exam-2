      <td> I used Adobe XD when I designed my prototype. I took my inspiration from Facebook and made my "/" page 
      my login page. Then I wanted the random list of posts to be on my home page. I also created a comment button
      so you could see the comments on each post. On My Profile page you can find the banner, avatar, 
      searchbar to find other profiles and a list of his/her personal posts. I also made a
      link in my nav bar to go to a Create Post page so you can easily and fast access and write and publish 
      your posts.
